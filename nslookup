NSLOOKUP

===========================



The nslookup command is a network administration tool used to query the Domain Name System (DNS) and obtain information about domain names, IP address mappings, and specific DNS records. It is commonly used for network troubleshooting and diagnostics.
What You Can Do with nslookup:

    Find the IP Address of a Domain:
    Example:

bash
nslookup google.com

This command will return the IP address(es) associated with google.com.

Reverse DNS Lookup (Find Domain from IP):
Example:

bash
nslookup 8.8.8.8

This will try to resolve the domain name for the IP address 8.8.8.8.

Check Different DNS Record Types:
You can specify the type of DNS record you want to look up (e.g., A, NS, MX, SOA, TXT):

    NS (Name Server):

bash
nslookup -type=ns example.com

MX (Mail Exchange):

bash
nslookup -type=mx example.com

SOA (Start of Authority):

    bash
    nslookup -type=soa example.com

Query a Specific DNS Server:
You can specify which DNS server to query:

bash
nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8

This will perform the lookup using Googleâ€™s DNS server (8.8.8.8).

Get All Available DNS Records for a Domain:

    bash
    nslookup -type=any example.com

Useful for:

    Troubleshooting network and DNS issues

    Verifying DNS configuration and propagation

    Checking email (MX) server settings

    Investigating domain ownership and server assignments
